            <p>Shadow Fight 2 took place in Japan's Tokugawa period in the late 1600s. The story starts with a great invincible warrior named Shadow travelling the land in search of a worthy opponent, til he stumbled upon the gates of shadows. It was told that it is forbidden to open the gates of shadows since it is a portal that opens the multiverse, leading to another world, but Shadow opened the gates, not knowing what curse he had just released into the world. As the gates opened, the demons from the other world have been released. They rushed upon Shadow, tearing his flesh, draining his soul, turning him into a shadow. After Shadow realized the threat he has brought into the world, he has a plan to defeat all of the 7 demons with the help of his sensei and his girlfriend May to save the world and obtain his physical form back. After defeating 6 demons, Shadow has to face the strongest demon named Titan, an emperor who is known to enslave worlds in the multiverse, who also kidnapped May and turned her evil. After saving May and an exhausting battle against Titan, Shadow destroyed Titan following the collapse of the Gates of Shadows, destroying the portal to the other world. After saving the world and Shadow regaining his physical form, Shadow and May left everything behind and started a new life far away and lived happily ever after. For nowâ€¦</p>
