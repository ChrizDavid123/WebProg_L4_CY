				<p>Gabe Newell, a Harvard University dropout, started his journey working for Microsoft, where he spent the next 13 years developing early versions of the Windows operating system. Gabe Newell went on to produce Windows 1.0 and Windows 2.0 and played a 
					key role in making Windows a gaming platform by porting Doom to Windows 95. <br><br>
					In 1996, Gabe Newell, after receiving lots of credit from Microsoft and earning him millions of dollars, partnered up with his co-worker Mike Harrington and started their own gaming company using their fortunes. By November 1998, they released 
					their debut game, Half-Life, which became a commercial success with 250,000 to 300,000 copies sold by the end of the year
